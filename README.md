# Template

This is a template project using Next js. My other projects will probably be built based on this project. You can use it as base project as well if you use Next js with tailwindcss & typescript.

## Getting Started

First, install pnpm using npm

```bash
npm i -g pnpm
```

then install all of the dependencies of the project with

```bash
pnpm i
```

at last, run development server using

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can see all of the commands you can run with pnpm on this project by visiting package.json scripts.
